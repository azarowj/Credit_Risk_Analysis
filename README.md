# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

- The primary purpose of this project is to train multiple machine learning models to determine credit risk. Then we evaluate the performance of the various models and make a recommendation on whether or not they should be used to predict credit risk. We will use RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEEN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier, and EasyEnsembleClassifier as our models.
